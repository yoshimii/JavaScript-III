/* The Four Principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window binding - When this is in the global scope the value of this will be the window object.
* 2. Implicit binding - Just like any other time we use a method (ex: array.indexOf()) the context of that method is what's on the left side of the dot. So this takes on the place of the object context name.
* 3. New binding - 
* 4. 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
